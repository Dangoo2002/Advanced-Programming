/**
 * This Lecture1_adt.Transaction2 Class takes the first step to resolve the ADT design issues of Transaction1:
 * 1. Representation Independence: --- Encapsulation - Providing access methods to the internal data.
 *                                     External client code only accesses via allowable operations
 *                                 --- Changes to internal representation can still be accessed via the same methods defined
 *
 * 2. Preservation of Invariants: --- Access modifies private final fields to make the data unchangeable
